/**
 * ADVERSARIAL QA AGENT — the deterministic half.
 *
 * Runs the game for N steps in a real headless Chromium, and spends most of
 * those steps trying to break it. Writes `findings.json` and `findings.csv`.
 *
 *     npm run adversary
 *     npm run adversary -- --steps 400 --seed 20260824
 *     npm run adversary -- --url http://localhost:5188 --headed
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT MAKES THIS AN ADVERSARY AND NOT A WALKER
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * `tools/walk.mjs` already plays the game correctly, end to end, and asserts on
 * live state. It is a good coverage walker and this does not replace it. The
 * difference is the strategy:
 *
 *   the walker  takes valid actions and checks the game kept working
 *   this        takes INVALID actions on purpose, and checks the game refused
 *
 * "Broken" is defined in exactly one place — `lib/invariants.mjs` — as a set of
 * relationships that must hold no matter what just happened. The loop checks
 * every one of them after every step, whichever probe fired. A probe's job is
 * only to create a state worth checking.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE LOOP
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *   1. snapshot the world
 *   2. run every applicable invariant against it            <- the judging
 *   3. drain page errors and console errors into findings
 *   4. pick an action: usually a probe, sometimes honest play
 *   5. repeat
 *
 * Honest play is in the mix on purpose. An adversary that only ever sends bad
 * input never leaves the first screen, and a bug on day 4 is a bug it cannot
 * reach. So `explore` walks the week with a coverage bias — preferring screens
 * it has not seen, and refusing to sit on sticky examinables, which is the trap
 * `tools/walk.mjs` documents.
 *
 * Exit code: 0 when nothing NEW was found, 1 when something new was, 2 for a
 * harness failure. Known issues never fail the run — that is what they are for.
