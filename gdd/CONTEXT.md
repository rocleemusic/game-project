# GDD

The full design-and-build spec for Festival of Souls, as one folder of linked domain files. This is build-support knowledge, not a separate public-facing document — no "deferred/cut" framing lives here; everything in this folder is in-scope reference for whoever is building.

Retires the `resources/build-gdd*_draft.md` lineage, archived to [`../resources/_archive/`](../resources/_archive/) as each compile cycle retires it (v1–v9 as of 2026-07-26). Where an older note or file says "Build GDD section N," it means the file listed below.

Operational rulings often land first in [`../CONTEXT.md`](../CONTEXT.md) (the session-facing layer) and are reconciled into these files at session close via `gdd-sync` (`commands/gdd-sync.md`, repo root). If the two disagree between syncs, the newer ruling wins; flag the gap rather than trusting either silently.

Files are numbered `00`–`14` to match reading order (see below) — a fresh sequential order, not the old fractional v5/v6 section numbers, since `07-cast.md` and `06-world-and-progression.md` both used to be "§6," and `09-art-direction.md` / `10-audio.md` / `13-scope-and-risks.md` never had a v5/v6 number at all (v4-only content folded in on 2026-07-26). `14-visual-style-guide.md` has no v4/v5 lineage at all — added 2026-08-19, once the Phaser UI-migration mockups needed a single reconciled spec. `00-world-bible.md` was added 2026-08-23 as the world's canon and reads *before* `01` — the concept, cast, and arcs all stand on it. It takes `00` rather than a renumber so no existing link churns. `compile.ps1` picks it up automatically (the `??-*.md` glob), and its `$parts` table gives it a *Part 0: The World* header.

## Workflow: compiling a review draft

For a full read-through or a class submission, Roc asks for a **"gdd compile."** The steps:

1. **Compile.** Run [`compile.ps1`](compile.ps1) — it stitches all 13 files into a new `../resources/build-gdd-vN_draft.md` (auto-incrementing N), the same shape as the retired drafts (v1–v9 as of 2026-07-26). Purely mechanical, no per-file judgment: each file's H1 becomes `## N. Title` (N = the file's numeric prefix) and each H2 inside it becomes `### N.x Title`, numbered in document order — nothing skipped or folded. Cross-file links like `[07-cast.md](07-cast.md)` become `#N`; `../resources/X` links collapse to `X` since the draft lives in `resources/` itself. Part headers (Part I–IV) come from a small fixed table at the top of the script, since grouping isn't derivable from the files themselves.
2. **Edit.** Roc reads and edits the draft directly — it's a normal working file, not read-only.
3. **Patch.** When Roc says the edit is done, Claude re-diffs the draft against the 13 `gdd/` files (the pattern used on 2026-07-26: cast.md's Juno line, the Narrative Director gap, the hard-wipe note, etc.), flags each divergence, confirms ambiguous ones with Roc, then patches the resolved changes into the relevant `gdd/*.md` files.
4. **Retire.** The draft moves to `../resources/_archive/`, same as every prior version.

| [`15-dialogue-inventory.md`](15-dialogue-inventory.md) | Tracking table for every authored dialogue entry in the T15/T16 rework (43 core rows: intro, greetings, encounters, spell beats, festival night) — carries fill status by design | *(new, 2026-08-23)* |

## Superseded, not carried forward

- v4 §12 "A Worked Soul Arc" (an empty fill-in template) — superseded by the real generated cards ([Toby's](../cast/toby.md), [Ilsa's](../cast/ilsa.md) — canonical copies live in [`../cast/`](../cast/)) and [`../narrative-pipeline/examples/worked-example-mara.md`](../narrative-pipeline/examples/worked-example-mara.md) — see [`07-cast.md`](07-cast.md).
- v4 §11 "The Narrative Process" — fully superseded by [`../narrative-pipeline/`](../narrative-pipeline/CONTEXT.md).
- v4's Non-Goals list (§4) — confirmed dropped intentionally, not restored (see [`02-pillars.md`](02-pillars.md)).
- The "community / diffuse / solitary-release" endings taxonomy some older notes cite — superseded by the festival-tier spectrum in [`03-core-loop.md`](03-core-loop.md); the taxonomy itself is preserved in [`../resources/parking-lot.md`](../resources/parking-lot.md), not deleted.

## Related, not duplicated here

- [`../narrative-pipeline/`](../narrative-pipeline/CONTEXT.md) — the full narrative-generation spec (steering, cards, echoes, gates, register, guardrails). `11-ai-agents-and-pipeline.md` names the crew; `narrative-pipeline/` is how they actually run.
- [`../resources/_archive/phase-3-decisions_draft.md`](../resources/_archive/phase-3-decisions_draft.md) — the underlying decisions log (H1–H18) these files were assembled from. Archived 2026-07-28; its content now lives here in `gdd/`, kept for history only.
- [`../knowledge-base/`](../knowledge-base/CONTEXT.md) — distilled *external* reference material (Frieren essays, Myst docs, craft-talk distillations). Not our own design decisions — those live here in `gdd/`. When a ruling reverses a knowledge-base recommendation, that doc gets a supersession banner the same session (the banner rule, `commands/gdd-sync.md`).
- [`../resources/_archive/`](../resources/_archive/) — the retired draft lineage (v1–v9 as of 2026-07-26 + process artifacts), kept for history, not for reference.
