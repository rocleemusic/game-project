// A gated choice node guards every option with the same availability condition.
// When the gate is false the choice point has no available option, and plain
// ink would stop there — the scene could not reach its gather and would
// dead-end. The emitter adds a fallback choice (`* -> gather`) that fires only
// when no normal option is available, so a failed gate skips the beat instead
// of blocking the scene from ending.
