// wait-choice.test.ts — T8, the Wait action (RULED by Roc 2026-08-24).
//
// The ruling has two halves, and both are only true if Wait is emitted as an
// ORDINARY EXIT that happens to lead back where it started:
//
//   1. it is a REAL INK CHOICE. The day clock only ever advances through ink,
//      so a host-side `setVar("TimeOfDay", ...)` shortcut is not a legal way
//      to build this — the choice has to exist in the compiled story.
//   2. it COSTS A MOVE, like every other time-consuming action. Which means
//      it runs `emitMoveTo`'s body unchanged: spend one move, and advance the
//      BLOCK (not the day) only once that block's budget is empty.
//
// CONTENT-AGNOSTIC BY CONTRACT, same rule as walk.test.ts and
// festival-night.test.ts: every assertion below is about ids, labels the
// EMITTER generates, and topology — never a line of placeholder prose.
