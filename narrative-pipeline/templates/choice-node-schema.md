# choice_node Schema

The unit that makes a player choice expressible. Closes spec change 7 (2026-07-25-giver run): `content_lines` is flat, and nothing in the card, the echo template, or step 8 could model a player option. This schema keeps `content_lines` flat. Branch structure lives in the scene graph; lines reference it by ID.

> **Amended 2026-08-01 — nesting (`parent_option`, `gather_line`).** v1 refused branch
> structure inside an option, so a sub-conversation could only be faked as sibling nodes
> gated on a flag the option set. Roc ratified real nesting after reading both shapes.
> The refusal it lifts and the cost it carries are in [Nesting](#nesting-a-sub-conversation-inside-one-option).
> Depth was raised **1 → 2** later the same day, after the cost was measured rather than
> guessed; the measurement is in [the cost](#the-cost-stated-plainly) and is the thing to
> repeat before raising it again.

**Who does what.** The **Choice designer** authors the node — the branch intent — in the layout/graph pass (`../pipeline.md` step 6). *(Amended 2026-08-06. This said "the Narrative Architect" and predates the split Roc ruled on 2026-08-04: the Architect owns the card, arc, threads, thread shape, dependency order and how many conversations a thread gets; the Choice designer owns conversations, gates, options, outcomes and fallbacks. The dividing line is what gets revealed versus when and how it can be reached. Seat contract: [`../../agents/choice-designer.md`](../../agents/choice-designer.md).)*

**Three rulings on options and responses (Roc, 2026-08-06).** Each was hit independently by every writer in the first two shelf batches, and each of them flagged it rather than guessing — which is correct behaviour and also a sign the schema was silent where it should have spoken.

1. **A response slot may be non-dialogue.** `action` and `object` are legal response slot types, not just set-up types. A soul answering by doing something rather than saying something is an answer.
2. **A response may be more than one line.** The 1–3 range is per option. For a beat where the soul is *receiving*, two is the floor, not the range's bottom end — see the receiving-pair rule in [`../pipeline.md`](../pipeline.md) step 8.
3. **A `Converse` option may be silent.** The verb family names the **arena** — you are in a conversation — and the quoting decides the **modality**: a quoted gist is spoken and takes a `player_line`, an unquoted gist is a deed and takes `slot_type: action` with no `player_line`. So `Converse` + `sit-with` + an unquoted gist is legal and correct. Choosing not to speak is a move inside a conversation, not the absence of one, and filing it under `Use` or `Collect` would put "said nothing" beside "picked up a crate".

**Proposing an examinable.** The Choice designer may **propose** an examinable to reopen a closed path — that is part of authoring, and downstream wires it into `tools/resolver/data/screen-specs.json`. It may never state that a proposed examinable already exists. A proposal is recorded in the thread document under **Proposed examinables**, naming the screen, the id, the flag it would set and the path it reopens, and every reference to it elsewhere in that document is marked PROPOSED. Until it is wired, the pickup path it names does not work, and a design that silently depends on one is a defect. *(Ruled by Roc 2026-08-04, after a brief asserted an `ex-shelf` examinable on T2 that did not exist.)* Code mints the IDs, compiles the conditions, and builds the ink weave. The Content Agent fills each option's line slots, one slot per call (step 8). The Verifier checks the two guards (checks 2 and 10). QA walks the edges. Roc approves at the gate; the review tool is the approval surface, and its `approvals.json` in the active run folder is the single gate record (`../../resources/review-tool-spec_draft.md`).

**Citing these ids in design documents.** The minted ids are machine addresses and stay exactly as specified below (GP-114, ruled 2026-08-09 — changing them is a migration). Every design-document mention of one carries the human-readable label per [`id-label-convention.md`](id-label-convention.md), which also owns the variant-suffix scheme and the nesting readout.

## The node

| Field | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `choice_id` | Code-minted, stable, format `CH-<screen>-<seq>` (e.g. `CH-T2-04`). Becomes the ink weave anchor and the `#choice:` tag — ink addresses derive by the address rule in `../build-loop.md` (lowercase, non-alphanumerics → `_`). |
| `scene_id` | The scene this node sits in. Minted by the layout/graph pass, format `SC-<screen>-<seq>`; its ink address is `<soul>.<scene>` per the same address rule. |
| `options` | 2 or 3 options (see below). Never 1. A node needing more than 3 **surfaces to the human gate as a decision** — same escalation shape as the delta ceiling (`../guardrails.md` check 3); the Architect may not widen it to fit its own content. |
| `availability_conditions` | Screen-state predicates that gate **the whole node** (vocabulary in `screen-spec-schema.md`). Code compiles them to ink guards. Empty means always available. Per-option conditions still do not exist — but the thing they were usually wanted for now has an answer: a beat that should play for one option only is that option's sub-node (`parent_option`), not a guard. **`bond_band(soul)` forks are exhaustive by construction** (RULED, Roc 2026-08-06 / GP-115): the engine always resolves a soul's bond to exactly one of `low · mid · high`, and `low` is the explicit floor for zero/unbonded — never null, never a fourth value, never an error. A three-way `= low | mid | high` fork on one soul's band needs no `else`/fallback branch; if you're reaching for one, the fork is probably missing a variant, not missing a default. |
| `equal_weight_note` | One sentence from the Architect stating why neither option is the correct answer. Required — check 10 flags a node missing either note. |
| `no_accrual_note` | One sentence stating that no counter keys off repeated selection of any option. Required — presence checked by check 10; the accrual *semantics* it promises are enforced by check 2. |
| `parent_option` | **Optional (2026-08-01).** An `option_id` in the same scene. Set it and this node plays *inside* that option instead of after the scene's previous gather. See [Nesting](#nesting-a-sub-conversation-inside-one-option) — it has rules the other fields do not. |
| `gather_line` | **Optional (2026-08-01).** A `content_id` whose text stands at this node's gather. Without one the gather keeps a generated placeholder, so an unauthored gather stays visible rather than reading as finished content. The line is an ordinary `dialogue` slot carrying this node's `choice_id` and **no** `option_id`. |

## An option

| Field | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `option_id` | Code-minted, stable: `<choice_id>-<letter>` (`CH-T2-04-a`). Becomes the `#opt:` tag. |
| `verb_family` | Collect · Make · Use · Converse — the family that carries this option (`../../gdd/03-core-loop.md`). |
| `player_verb` | witness · ease · sit-with — the player's part, from the arc doc's family-pressure and social-conflict tables ([`../arc-festival-slice.md`](../arc-festival-slice.md)), which define the three by example. Working definitions: *witness* = be present and take it in, change nothing; *ease* = lighten the load without resolving the cause; *sit-with* = share the weight in silence, no fix offered. Never fix, never resolve. **Hidden authoring metadata: it never appears on screen.** |
| `player_line` | For a spoken option: a reference to the content slot holding the words the player says. The option the player sees **is this line** — a dialogue pick, the-intercept style — never a feelings label. |
| `surface_action` | For an unspoken option: the diegetic deed, phrased as **a verb acting on a named thing** ("pick up the trays", "leave the bread"). Renders bracketed. The deed test is what separates it from a banned feelings label: `[Pick up the trays]` names an observable act; `[Comfort him]` names an internal state — a defect (check 10 covers both option shapes). Spoken and unspoken options coexist in one node. Exactly one of `player_line` / `surface_action` per option. |
| `response_slots` | 1–3 content-slot references, each an ordinary `dialogue` slot (40-word ceiling, `speaker_intent` required, full register rules). The soul answers the player's specific words or deed, within 1–3 lines (efficiently-branching-narrative.md). |
| `state_actions` | Zero or more, from the closed enum, each with its argument: `bond_event(category)` — category ∈ Trust · Intimacy · Recognition · Respect (`../pipeline.md` step 9); `knowledge_flag(name)` — name must be a `state.ink` declaration (predicate vocabulary, `screen-spec-schema.md`); `thread_move(thread_id)` — thread_id from the arc doc's thread list ([`../arc-festival-slice.md`](../arc-festival-slice.md)); `canon_write(fact)` — human-gated, always. Nothing else; no new types without a schema change at the gate. |
| `rejoin` | `gather` (default) — the branch rejoins the scene at a gather point. `divert` — the branch exits to a different node. **A divert that passes the five-condition test below is sanctioned and needs no escalation; one that fails any condition is flagged to Roc** (ruled 2026-08-09, superseding "flags every divert"). Rejoin-by-default keeps QA's walk linear in choice count. An option that carries a sub-conversation may not also `divert`: a diverting option leaves the scene, so its sub-nodes could never play. The build throws rather than emitting dead beats. |

## The presentation rule

The register bans a labeled menu of feelings (`../build-loop.md`). It does not ban dialogue. A spoken option presents as the player's actual words; an unspoken option presents as the interaction itself (examine, go, offer). `[Comfort him]` is a defect. `"Let me carry the trays at least."` is the form.

`player_line` is its own slot type: speech, spoken by the player, ceiling 12 words. The player voice contract is the player entry in `../register.md`. `speaker_intent` does not apply — the option's `player_verb` carries the authoring-side meaning, and what the words mean to the player stays the player's.

## The two guards

1. **Neither option is the correct answer.** Some souls do not want the help (the Giver × Content Server row: "the help isn't wanted"). If one option is always right, the choice is decoration and the festival tier degrades into a niceness meter. The `equal_weight_note` must say, concretely, what each option costs and what it respects. Verifier check 10 flags an option that reads as sanctioned: asymmetric reward in `state_actions`, a response that scolds the other pick, or a yes/no/maybe shape.
2. **Repeated selection accumulates nothing.** Being helped is not being claimed; the threshold beat is the soul's own act. A `bond_event` is one delta through the existing single hidden count (`../pipeline.md` step 9) — legal. A stored per-option counter, or any state that unlocks at N picks of the same option, is check 2's flag on sight.

## Nesting: a sub-conversation inside one option

**Ratified 2026-08-01.** One option carries its own beats — a further choice point, a beat, another choice point — and every path through it converges before the parent node's gather takes over. Set `parent_option` on each node that belongs inside that option.

### What it replaced, and why the difference matters

Before this, the only way to hang a conversation off one option was to make the option set a `knowledge_flag` and gate the *following sibling nodes* on `knows(flag)`. That plays almost the same and is structurally different in three ways that bite:

- **The set-up line of a gated node prints ungated.** Only the options carry the guard, so a player who never took the branch still reads its framing. (Live example: `CH-T4-02-3`'s "with the second set named…" prints to a player who never named it.)
- **Every player walks past the beat**, taking a silent fallback. The branch is a skip, not a containment.
- **The convergence point is the scene's, not the option's** — so nothing in the data says "these paths belong to that option."

Nesting removes all three, and removes machinery doing it: no flag, no gate guards, no fallback lines.

### Rules

| Rule | Why |
|---|---|
| `parent_option` must name an option **in the same scene**. | The sub-nodes emit inside that option's branch; a cross-scene reference has no branch to emit into. Build throws. |
| **Two levels deep** (`MAX_NESTING` in `graph.ts`). A third level is rejected, as is a `parent_option` cycle. | Each level multiplies the scene. The number is policy, not mechanics — see [the cost](#the-cost-stated-plainly). Raising it means re-running the reachability search, not just editing the constant. |
| Sub-nodes under one option emit **in array order**, and the **last one gathers at `g_<option_id>`**. | That label is the option's convergence point — the thing "all paths gather here" means. Intermediate sub-nodes keep their own `g_<choice_id>`. |
| A sub-node is emitted **once**, by its option — never also at scene level. | Otherwise the same beat appears twice in one scene. |
| An option carrying sub-nodes may not `rejoin: divert`. | It would leave the scene before its own beats could play. |

### When a divert is sanctioned (ruled by Roc, 2026-08-09)

A divert models **the player going elsewhere**. The beats it skips are not conditionally hidden; they are not reached, because the path left. That is what the field is for, and it is the *only* way to express it — the alternative, gating the skipped beats on "you did not take that option", requires negation, which is not in the predicate vocabulary (`GP-124`, `../../agents/choice-designer.md`).

**A divert is sanctioned without escalation when all five hold:**

1. **The option is a relocation, not a topic choice.** The player physically or attentionally goes elsewhere — walks on down the treeline, puts their hands in the work. Choosing a subject never diverts.
2. **The reveal survives.** The conversation's reveal is ungated or precedes the pick, so the diverted player receives it whole. A divert may cost depth; it may never cost the reveal.
3. **The diverted branch records something.** Otherwise it is the cheap exit wearing equal-weight clothing (rule 17).
4. **Every flag the divert skips is recoverable** — read by a later conversation, or reopened by a declared examinable.
5. **It lands on a node every incoming state reaches** — a gather or the close. No state may dead-end on it.

**Escalate to Roc when any condition fails** — chiefly a divert that skips the only route to a reveal, or skips a flag with no downstream reader and no pickup.

**Why not add negation instead.** It would collapse this whole class in one regex change, and it is the wrong trade. A negated gate that compiles wrong does not error — it makes a branch **silently unreachable**, which is how `ilsa-kin-no-show` C2 shipped broken and stayed broken. A divert fails loudly by comparison: the edge is drawn in the graph, so a reviewer sees it at the gate.

### The cost, stated plainly

`rejoin: gather` is the default **specifically** to keep QA's walk linear in choice count. Nesting makes it multiplicative — and the multiplication is **scene-wide, not branch-local**, which is the part that surprises people.

A scene's cost is the *product* of its nodes' branching, because the reachability search explores each scene's option tree exhaustively and counts one "path" per complete option-sequence. So nesting one option multiplies **every** node in the scene. Measured on SC-T4-02 (2026-08-01), by building a de-nested copy and diffing:

| | Paths in SC-T4-02 | Whole-search total |
|---|---|---|
| no nesting | 192 | 2474 |
| one nested option (3-option node + 2-option node) | **672** | 2954 |

A 3.5× jump in the scene for one nested option. The same nesting in a ten-node scene would have cost far more — cost tracks how many nodes the scene *already* has, not how big the nested part is.

**The relevant cap is `maxScenePaths` (4000), and it is per scene visit, not per search.** Do not compare it against the whole-search total. Two things to know about it:

- At the cap the DFS sets `capped` and **stops early, abandoning unexplored branches**. `bounds.hit` goes true, and from then on "unreachable" means *not found within budget* rather than *proven unreachable* — the traversal proof quietly stops being a proof.
- The wall-clock budget (`maxMillis`, 120s) is checked **between** scenes, never inside a scene's DFS. So `maxScenePaths` is the only thing bounding a single runaway scene. At the 2026-08-01 measurement the whole search ran 3.2s of the 120s allowance, so time is not the binding constraint — path count is.

**`MAX_NESTING` is a policy number, not a mechanical one.** Nothing breaks at three levels; the deepest authored scene uses 672 of 4000 and depth ~8 of `maxSceneDepth` 40. It is set where it is so that a further level has to be argued for with a measurement. Raising it means re-running the search and confirming `bounds.hit` is still false.

The two guards are unchanged and apply to a nested node exactly as to any other: neither option is the correct answer, and repeated selection accumulates nothing.

## How a choice feeds the festival tier

Through its concrete world consequence only. Help with the feast and the feast is further along; that is the role-goal moving, the same engine as everything else (`../../gdd/03-core-loop.md`). Decline and your time-block is yours elsewhere, and the soul's deflection stands — sometimes the right read. No stored scalar records which options the player picks. Both branches produce valid, different worlds; the tier reads the world, not the picks.

## ink mapping (what code builds — step 6's contract, made concrete)

One choice_node compiles to one weave block. Names and tags come from the minted IDs; the Content lines drop into the slots.

```
= sc_t2_04                        // scene stitch, from SC-T2-04 by the address rule
<set-up line> #choice:CH-T2-04
* ["<player_line a>"] #opt:CH-T2-04-a
    ~ <state_actions a>
    <response slots a>
* [<surface_action b>] #opt:CH-T2-04-b
    ~ <state_actions b>
    <response slots b>
- (g_ch_t2_04) <scene continues>
```

Every address above derives from its minted ID by the address rule in `../build-loop.md` (lowercase, non-alphanumerics → `_`, gathers prefixed `g_`); the tags keep the original ID form. `availability_conditions` compile to one `{ }` guard applied to the node's choice lines. A `divert` replaces the gather with a `->` to the target node. **`state_actions` emit as EXTERNAL calls** (`~ recordBond(SOUL_B, intimacy)` — the ink-data-model D1 shape); the host binds them for real, and the canned web export binds no-op stubs. Narration proposes, code disposes; ink never stores the bond.

### A nested node (2026-08-01)

ink counts nesting by marker repetition, so depth is the only thing that changes: `*`→`**`, `-`→`--`. Indentation is for the human reading the generated file — ink ignores it.

```
* [<surface_action b>] #opt:CH-T2-04-b
    ~ <state_actions b>
    <response slots b>
    ** ["<player_line>"] #opt:CH-T2-04-b-1-a #choice:CH-T2-04-b-1
        ~ <state_actions>
        <response slots>
    ** [<surface_action>] #opt:CH-T2-04-b-1-b
        <response slots>
    -- (g_ch_t2_04_b_1) <gather_line of CH-T2-04-b-1 — a beat, not filler>
    ** [<surface_action>] #opt:CH-T2-04-b-2-a #choice:CH-T2-04-b-2
        <response slots>
    ** [<surface_action>] #opt:CH-T2-04-b-2-b
        <response slots>
    -- (g_ch_t2_04_b) <gather_line — every path through option b lands here>
- (g_ch_t2_04) <scene continues — option a arrives here directly>
```

Note the last sub-gather is `g_ch_t2_04_b`, the **option's** address, not the sub-node's. `#choice:` rides the first option line when a node has no set-up line, which is the usual shape for a nested node — its opening is the parent option's response.

## Acceptance case — Line 04, the Giver's receive-beat

The first choice_node through the pipeline is the beat that forced this schema. Hand-authored dry run, for shape only (prose is placeholder, not approved content):

- **Scene:** Toby, dealt Baker, behind on the feast. Set-up line: he waves the player off — "It's nothing. Go on."
- **Option a** — spoken. `player_verb: ease` · `verb_family: Converse` · `player_line`: "Let me carry the trays at least." · response: Toby goes flat and short, receiving (his spread's asymmetry — animated giving, flat receiving, warmth intact). `state_actions: bond_event(Intimacy), thread_move(giver-receive)`.
- **Option b** — spoken. `player_verb: witness` · `verb_family: Converse` · `player_line`: "Alright. Save me a sweet roll." · response: Toby quickens again, attention pointed back out. `state_actions: thread_move(giver-receive)`.
- **`equal_weight_note`:** helping moves the feast (external, tier) and spends the player's block; declining respects the surface request — the Content Server row proves easing off is sometimes the right read. The bond delta on (a) is not a reward: bond has no UI, never gates an essence fact, and (b)'s presence still counts as time spent.
- **`no_accrual_note`:** no counter keys off (a). Toby's claimed-beat is his own act, gated on the arc thread, never on a help count.
- **`rejoin: gather`** — the scene continues either way; the branch carries what follows, not who won.

Check against the guards before any generation: neither response scolds; state_actions are asymmetric in kind (thread vs. thread+bond) but not in rank (neither carries `canon_write` — the rank rule, check 10); and the shape passes the yes/no test because the test is on **consequences, not surface grammar** — accept/decline the same offer would fail only if both roads led to interchangeable responses and consequences, and here each option carries a distinct world consequence (the feast moves vs. the block is spent elsewhere and the deflection stands) and its own authored response.

## What this schema refuses

- No branch trees inside `content_lines` — the array stays flat; items gain optional `choice_id` and `option_id` back-references, nothing else. **Still true after the 2026-08-01 nesting amendment:** `parent_option` and `gather_line` are back-references on the *node*, of exactly the same kind. Nothing became a tree; a node just learned which option it plays inside.
- No per-option stored counters, no pick-history state, no choice log the runtime reads.
- No runtime generation: every option and response is authored at build time and compiled to ink.
- No third shape: an option is spoken or it is a deed. An option that is a feeling is a defect.
- **No nesting past `MAX_NESTING` levels** (2 as of 2026-08-01), and no per-option `availability_conditions`. The second was asked for and was answered by nesting instead: a beat that should only play for one option is that option's sub-node, not a guard. Either remains a schema change at the gate, and the nesting one now requires a measurement with it.
